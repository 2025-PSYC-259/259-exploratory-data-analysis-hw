#> These data are drawn from the fivethirtyeight article:
#> http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-12-months-of-record-setting-temperatures-looks-like-across-the-u-s/
#> The directory us-weather-history contains a data file for each of 10 cities, labelled by their station name
#> Each data file contains:
#> `date` | The date of the weather record, formatted YYYY-M-D
#> `actual_mean_temp` | The measured average temperature for that day
#> `actual_min_temp` | The measured minimum temperature for that day
#> `actual_max_temp` | The measured maximum temperature for that day
#> `average_min_temp` | The average minimum temperature on that day since 1880
#> `average_max_temp` | The average maximum temperature on that day since 1880
#> `record_min_temp` | The lowest ever temperature on that day since 1880
#> `record_max_temp` | The highest ever temperature on that day since 1880
#> `record_min_temp_year` | The year that the lowest ever temperature occurred
#> `record_max_temp_year` | The year that the highest ever temperature occurred
#> `actual_precipitation` | The measured amount of rain or snow for that day
#> `average_precipitation` | The average amount of rain or snow on that day since 1880
#> `record_precipitation` | The highest amount of rain or snow on that day since 1880

stations <- c("KCLT", "KCQT", "KHOU", "KIND", "KJAX", "KMDW", "KNYC", "KPHL", "KPHX", "KSEA")
cities <- c("Charlotte", "Los Angeles", "Houston", "Indianapolis", "Jacksonville", 
            "Chicago", "New York City", "Philadelphia", "Phoenix", "Seattle")



#> Write a function that takes each station abbreviation and reads
#> the data file and adds the station name in a column
#> Make sure the date column is a date
#> The function should return a tibble
#> Call the function "read_weather" 
#> Check by reading/glimpsing a single station's file




#> Use map_dfr() and your new function to read in all 10 stations
#> map_dfr() will take each dataframe and automatically bind them.
#> Save the resulting dataset to "ds"




#> Make a factor called "city" based on the station variable
#> (station should be the level and city should be the label)
#> Use fct_count to check that there are 365 days of data for each city 



#> Since we're scientists, let's convert all the temperatures to C
#> Write a function to convert F to C, and then use mutate across to 
#> convert all of the temperatures, rounded to a tenth of a degree



#> Write a function that counts the number of extreme temperature days,
#> Where the actual min or max was equal to the (i.e., set the) record min/max
#> Group the dataset by city to see how many extreme days each city experienced,
#> and sort in descending order to show which city had the most



#> Pull out the month from the date and make "month" a factor
#> Split the tibble by month into a list of tibbles 



#> For each month, determine the correlation between the actual_precipitation
#> and the average_precipitation (across all cities), and between the actual and average mins/maxes
#> Use a for loop, and print the month along with the resulting correlation
